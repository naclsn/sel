(naming rules?)
<!--
- functions names should come obvious from usual names in other programming  languages and a few rules (and common english - last resort)
- having multiple names perform the exact same operation is a plus for discoverability; this may ne preferable from introducing obscure, slight discrepencies between functions
- in that idea, it is ok if a name does not strictly follow the rules if it is easier to come up with
- not finding the exact name should not be too penalizing: there should be an other obvious (potentially more verbose) to express the same operation

"rules" / "naming conventions": prefixes to a noun/adj/verb or suffixes to a verb to modify it
* is-: function is a predicate
* un-: function has the opposite action
* -if: function takes a predicate
* -where
* -while
* -by: function takes a key-selector

categories of functions:
* predicate: returns a `Num` in 0 or 1, where 1 indicates the last argument verifies the tested property (eg. `isodd`, `isin {..}`...)
* key-selector: selects a specific part/property of its input for use in a function (typ. `len`, as in `sortby len`)
