def iterate:
    create an infinite list where
    * the first item is given,
    * the second is calculated by applying the function on it,
    * the third item by applying the function on the previous result
    and so on:
    [ let f
    [ let v
        #[iterate f v, cons v] ]],
        [cons v [iterate f v]] ]],
